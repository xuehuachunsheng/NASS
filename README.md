# NASS
Official Implementation of Generalized Active Stratified Sampling, Neighborhood Active Stratified Sampling, and Class-rebalanced deep active learning with renormalization group multiscale structural complexity.

We provide the official implementations of the Generalized Active Stratified Sampling (GASS) approach family. The stuck pipe dataset is private and please contact us for requiring if needed. Users can adopt any other classification datasets to test our approach.

More details of NASS and its several variants will be supplied soon. Author email: yanxuewu2023@163.com
